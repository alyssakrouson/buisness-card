                    <p>I am a graduated student from the University of Rhode Island where I studied computer science and Japanese. 
                        I am interested in web development and furthering my knowledge in design and functionality. I currently work well with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am learning new frameworks like React.
                        I try to continue practicing my skills, and am always looking for new things to learn.</p>
